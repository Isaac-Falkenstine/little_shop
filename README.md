# Pub Shop
> Where you can buy everything you need for a good time!

This website has a variety of beers and foods on display, which you can add to your
cart, and then make a order! When you make a account you can change your
personal information and make a cart of items which you can use to create a order.
But be carful, when you log out your cart is emptied.

As a registered merchant you can add items that you'd like to sell, you can edit
those items and enable/disable them if you'd like to stop selling them.

If you're lucky enough to become a registered site admin, you can upgrade users
to merchants, you can ban users from using the site, and you can see all of a
merchant's items, edit them, and add new items for a merchant.

## Installing / Getting started

If you'd like to use this site, all you need to do it find a place you'd like to
store it on your computer, and then clone it onto your computer. Once it's cloned
and you've entered into the project, you should run 'bundle install' and 'bundle update'
and then all you need to do is run 'rails s' in your command line and then visit
the site 'localhost:3000' and you should be all good to go!
