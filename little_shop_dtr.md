### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

- What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?

- What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

  Pairing for basic functionality and any tasks that are difficult for anyone in the group. (Speak up)

  Divide-conquer for easier/laborious tasks

- How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

  Be direct. Norm is a skeptic and might need evidence, but will pick battles and accept when something should just be tried. If you're stuck on something for more than 30 minutes SLACK EVERYONE ON THE TEAM - someone will ask for help.
